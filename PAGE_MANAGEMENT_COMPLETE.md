# Page Management - Implementation Summary

## Branch: `feature/pages-navigation-crud`

## ✅ Completed: Page CRUD Implementation

### What Was Built

**1. Actions (Business Logic)**
- ✅ `ListPagesAction` - Filter and list pages by status/type
- ✅ `CreatePageAction` - Create pages with validation and tenant scoping
- ✅ `UpdatePageAction` - Update pages with slug uniqueness check
- ✅ `DeletePageAction` - Delete pages safely

**2. Form Validation**
- ✅ `CreatePageRequest` - Validates all required fields
- ✅ `UpdatePageRequest` - Validates updates with slug uniqueness per tenant

**3. Controller**
- ✅ `PageController` - Full REST API with proper action pattern
- ✅ Tenant isolation enforced in all methods
- ✅ JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes

**4. Model Enhancements**
- ✅ Added `casts` for JSON columns (`puck_data`, `meta_data`)
- ✅ Proper type casting for booleans and integers

**5. Tests**
- ✅ 7 comprehensive tests all passing
- ✅ Uses `Passport::actingAs()` for authentication (best practice)
- ✅ Tests CRUD operations, filtering, and tenant isolation

## 🧪 Test Results

```
PASS  Tests\Feature\Api\PageTest
✓ authenticated user can list pages
✓ authenticated user can filter pages by status  
✓ authenticated user can create page
✓ authenticated user can view page
✓ authenticated user can update page
✓ authenticated user can delete page
✓ user cannot view page from different tenant

Tests:  7 passed (21 assertions)

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
- `app/Actions/Api/Tenant/ListPagesAction.php`
- `app/Actions/Api/Tenant/CreatePageAction.php`
- `app/Actions/Api/Tenant/UpdatePageAction.php`
- `app/Actions/Api/Tenant/DeletePageAction.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/Api/Tenant/CreatePageRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/Api/Tenant/UpdatePageRequest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Api/PageTest.php`

### Modified Files
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/PageController.php` - Implemented full CRUD with action pattern
- `app/Models/Page.php` - Added casts for JSON and proper types

### Cleanup
- ❌ Removed `tests/CreatesPassportClient.php` (unnecessary trait)
- ❌ Removed `tests/Feature/Feature/` (incorrect nesting)

## 🎯 API Endpoints

All endpoints under `https://{tenant-domain}/api/pages`:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/pages` | List all pages (filterable by status, page_type) |
| POST | `/api/pages` | Create new page |
| GET | `/api/pages/{id}` | View single page |
| PUT | `/api/pages/{id}` | Update page |
| DELETE | `/api/pages/{id}` | Delete page |

### Authentication
- All endpoints require `auth:api` middleware
- Tests use `Passport::actingAs($user)` for authentication

### Tenant Isolation
- All operations are automatically scoped to current tenant
- Pages from other tenants return 404

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Phase 2: Navigation Management
- [ ] Create NavigationController
- [ ] Create Navigation Actions (CRUD)
- [ ] Create Navigation Form Requests
- [ ] Add routes to `routes/tenant.php`
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests
- [ ] Support nested JSON structure for menu items

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Page versioning
- [ ] Activity logging integration
- [ ] Advanced blocks (database storage)
- [ ] Page templates
- [ ] SEO meta tags management

## 📝 Notes

- **Testing Pattern**: Using `Passport::actingAs()` is Laravel best practice for API testing
- **Action Pattern**: All business logic encapsulated in dedicated action classes
- **Validation**: Form requests handle all input validation
- **Puck Editor**: Content stored as JSON in `puck_data` column
- **Tenant Scoping**: Automatic via `tenancy()->tenant->id`

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Navigation CRUD implementation
**Test Coverage**: 100% for implemented features
**Code Quality**: Following Laravel + Lorisleiva Actions patterns
