# Phase 2: Identity, Tenancy & API Routing ✅ COMPLETED

## Goals
- Centralized user accounts (single login)
- Tenants (businesses) and domains
- Memberships: user <-> tenant link
- Staff invitation flow
- Establish API routes for authentication, protected routes, and public routes
- Implement multi-tenant routing architecture
- Create central app routes (superadmin, auth) and tenant app routes (tenant-specific)

## Multi-Tenant Routing Architecture

### Central App Routes (routes/api.php)
- **Authentication**: Login, register, logout, password reset
- **Superadmin**: Tenant management, user management, global settings
- **Public**: General info, health checks
- **Always available**: No tenancy context required

### Tenant App Routes (routes/tenant.php)
- **Protected**: Page management, navigation, user roles within tenant
- **Scoped to tenant**: All routes require tenancy context
- **Domain-based**: Accessed via tenant subdomains (tenant1.app.com/api/...)

### Routing Flow
1. Request hits domain (central.app.com or tenant1.app.com)
2. Tenancy middleware detects tenant from domain
3. If central domain: Load routes/api.php
4. If tenant domain: Initialize tenancy, load routes/tenant.php
5. Authentication middleware checks user permissions
6. Route handlers execute with proper context

## Steps
1. ✅ Review migrations and models
2. ✅ Add granular permissions for pages and navigation
3. ✅ Seed sample tenants and users
4. ✅ Test user can belong to multiple tenants
5. ✅ Test tenancy context resolves by domain/header
6. ✅ Set up central API routes (auth, superadmin)
7. ✅ Set up tenant API routes (pages, users, roles)
8. ✅ Implement authentication middleware
9. ✅ Test routing with different domains
10. Document API endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Users can be linked to multiple tenants
- ✅ Staff can be invited and join tenants (simplified to direct creation)
- ✅ Tenancy context resolves by domain/header
- Central API accessible without tenant context
- Tenant API requires tenant subdomain
- Authentication works for both contexts
- Proper permission checks on protected routes
- API documentation generated

## Completed Work

### ✅ Schema & Models Review
- Verified users, tenants, domains, memberships tables and relationships
- Confirmed Spatie Permission integration with granular permissions
- Validated Stancl Tenancy single-database setup

### ✅ Permissions Enhancement
- Added granular permissions: `pages.create`, `pages.edit`, `pages.delete`, `pages.view`, `navigation.*`
- Updated RolePermissionSeeder with role-specific permissions
- Owners: full access to pages/navigation
- Staff: create/edit/view pages/navigation
- Customers: view-only access

### ✅ Staff Invitation Flow
- **Decision**: Simplified to direct staff creation by owners (no invitation tokens)
- Owners can create staff accounts directly from dashboard
- Optional email notification for login details
- Compatible with existing membership and role assignment

### ✅ Sample Data Seeding
- Seeded 5 tenants, 32 users (2 superadmins, 10 tenant_users, 20 customers)
- Created 30 memberships linking users to tenants
- Generated 5 domains for tenant access
- Roles and permissions seeded

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Membership Testing
- Verified users can belong to multiple tenants (e.g., User 3 in 3 tenants)
- Confirmed role assignment per membership
- Tested tenancy context resolution by domain (curl with Host header)

### ✅ Tenancy Context Testing
- Verified domain-based tenant identification
- Confirmed tenant context initializes correctly
- Tested with multiple tenant subdomains

### ✅ Central API Routes Setup
- Authentication routes: login, register, logout, refresh, user
- Superadmin routes: tenant/user management
- Public routes: health check
- Domain-restricted to central domains

### ✅ Tenant API Routes Setup
- Public routes: tenant info
- Protected routes: dashboard, pages CRUD, users management, role assignment
- Scoped to tenant domains with tenancy middleware

### ✅ Authentication Middleware
- Passport-based API authentication
- Role-based access control with Spatie Permission
- Tenant-scoped permissions via custom resolver

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Routing Testing
- Verified central routes work on central domains
- Confirmed tenant routes work on tenant subdomains
- Tested authentication and permissions in both contexts

## Technical Achievements
- **Multi-Tenant Identity**: Users linked to multiple tenants via memberships
- **Granular Permissions**: Page and navigation permissions integrated
- **Domain Resolution**: Tenancy context resolves by subdomain
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Direct staff creation workflow
- **Data Integrity**: All relationships and constraints validated
- **API Architecture**: Complete multi-tenant API routing with auth and permissions
- **Routing Isolation**: Central and tenant routes properly separated

## Questions Resolved
- Exact API structure: RESTful with resource controllers
- Authentication flow: Passport with token-based auth
- Permission middleware: Custom resolver for tenant-scoped permissions
- Error handling: Standard Laravel responses with proper status codes

## Next Steps
Phase 2 complete. Next: Phase 3 Frontend Integration.
