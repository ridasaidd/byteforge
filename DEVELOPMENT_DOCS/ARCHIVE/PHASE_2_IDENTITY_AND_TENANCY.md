# Phase 2: Identity & Tenancy ✅ COMPLETED

## Goals
- Centralized user accounts (single login)
- Tenants (businesses) and domains
- Memberships: user <-> tenant link
- Staff invitation flow

## Steps
1. ✅ Review migrations and models
2. ✅ Add granular permissions for pages and navigation
3. ✅ Seed sample tenants and users
4. ✅ Test user can belong to multiple tenants
5. ✅ Test tenancy context resolves by domain/header

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Users can be linked to multiple tenants
- ✅ Staff can be invited and join tenants (simplified to direct creation)
- ✅ Tenancy context resolves by domain/header

## Completed Work

### ✅ Schema & Models Review
- Verified users, tenants, domains, memberships tables and relationships
- Confirmed Spatie Permission integration with granular permissions
- Validated Stancl Tenancy single-database setup

### ✅ Permissions Enhancement
- Added granular permissions: `pages.create`, `pages.edit`, `pages.delete`, `pages.view`, `navigation.*`
- Updated RolePermissionSeeder with role-specific permissions
- Owners: full access to pages/navigation
- Staff: create/edit/view pages/navigation
- Customers: view-only access

### ✅ Staff Invitation Flow
- **Decision**: Simplified to direct staff creation by owners (no invitation tokens)
- Owners can create staff accounts directly from dashboard
- Optional email notification for login details
- Compatible with existing membership and role assignment

### ✅ Sample Data Seeding
- Seeded 5 tenants, 32 users (2 superadmins, 10 tenant_users, 20 customers)
- Created 30 memberships linking users to tenants
- Generated 5 domains for tenant access
- Roles and permissions seeded

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Membership Testing
- Verified users can belong to multiple tenants (e.g., User 3 in 3 tenants)
- Confirmed role assignment per membership
- Tested tenancy context resolution by domain (curl with Host header)

### ✅ Tenancy Context Testing
- Verified domain-based tenant identification
- Confirmed tenant context initializes correctly
- Tested with multiple tenant subdomains

## Technical Achievements
- **Multi-Tenant Identity**: Users linked to multiple tenants via memberships
- **Granular Permissions**: Page and navigation permissions integrated
- **Domain Resolution**: Tenancy context resolves by subdomain
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Direct staff creation workflow
- **Data Integrity**: All relationships and constraints validated

## Next Steps
Phase 2 complete. Next: Phase 2.5 API Routing Setup (priority over Phase 3).
