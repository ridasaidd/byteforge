# Phase 3: Frontend Integration

## Goals
- Build React SPA frontend for ByteForge page builder SaaS
- Integrate Puck editor for visual page building
- Create superadmin dashboard for tenant and user management
- Implement role-based access and multi-tenant awareness

## Tech Stack Decision
- **React + TypeScript** (not Next.js) for consistency with previous project
- **Vite** for build system
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Puck Editor** for visual page building
- **Laravel Passport** for authentication
- **Axios** for API calls

## Serving Architecture
- Laravel serves React SPA using catch-all route (like previous project)
- React handles client-side routing
- API calls to Laravel backend
- Multi-tenancy via subdomain detection in frontend

## Steps
1. Set up React + Vite project in resources/js
2. Configure Passport authentication integration
3. Create superadmin dashboard layout
4. Integrate Puck editor for page building
5. Implement tenant management interface
6. Add user management features
7. Test multi-tenancy routing in frontend
8. Document phase completion

## Acceptance Criteria
- Superadmin can log in and access dashboard
- Puck editor works for creating pages
- Tenant management (create, edit, delete tenants)
- User management with role assignment
- Frontend detects tenant context from subdomain
- Responsive design across devices

## Questions to Resolve
- Exact location for React app (resources/js vs separate directory)
- How to handle tenant-specific page viewing
- Authentication flow details
- Puck component integration specifics
