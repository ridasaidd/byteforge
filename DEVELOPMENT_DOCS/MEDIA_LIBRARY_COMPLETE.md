## 🎯 Feature Overview

A complete WordPress-style media library for the ByteForge multi-tenant SaaS platform with enterprise-grade security, folder organization, and intuitive file management.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### Frontend Components

#### Pages
- **MediaLibraryPage.tsx** - Main page with dual-pane layout (browser + details)

#### Organisms (Complex Components)
- **MediaBrowser** - File/folder grid with list/grid view toggle, drag-drop upload
- **FolderNavigation** - Breadcrumb navigation with home + folder path
- **MediaDetailsPanel** - Right panel showing file details, preview, metadata

#### Molecules (Composite Components)
- **MediaCard** - File card with image preview, file info, actions menu
- **FolderCard** - Folder card with rename/delete, click to navigate
- **MediaUploader** - Drag-drop zone + file input with progress tracking
- **ConfirmDialog** - Reusable confirmation modal for destructive actions

#### UI Components
- **Progress** - shadcn/ui progress bar for upload status

---

### Backend Implementation

#### Controllers
- **MediaController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/MediaController.php`)
  - `index()` - List files with folder filtering
  - `store()` - Upload file with validation
  - `destroy()` - Delete file
  - Supports both central and tenant contexts

- **MediaFolderController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/Tenant/MediaFolderController.php`)
  - `index()` - List folders
  - `store()` - Create folder with duplicate prevention
  - `update()` - Rename folder
  - `destroy()` - Delete folder with cascade deletion

#### Actions (Business Logic)
- **ListMediaAction** - Optimized queries with JOINs, filters system collections
- **UploadMediaAction** - Handle file upload, Spatie media library integration
- **DeleteMediaAction** - Remove file and database record
- **DeleteFolderAction** - Recursive folder deletion with stats

#### Models
- **Media** - Extended with global tenant scope, relationships
- **MediaLibrary** - Spatie HasMedia implementation with collections
- **MediaFolder** - Folder organization model

#### Request Validation
- **UploadMediaRequest** - **CRITICAL SECURITY**
  - Dual-layer MIME type validation (`mimes` + `mimetypes`)
  - File size limit (10MB)
  - Config-based whitelist
  - User-friendly error messages

- **CreateFolderRequest** - Duplicate name prevention validation

#### Configuration
- **config/media-upload.php** - Centralized security configuration
  - `allowed_mime_types` - Whitelist of safe MIME types
  - `allowed_extensions` - File extension whitelist
  - `max_file_size` - File size limit
  - `blocked_extensions` - Explicit blocklist
  - `blocked_mime_types` - MIME type blocklist

---

### Database

#### Migrations
- **2025_10_22_120315_make_tenant_id_nullable_in_media_libraries_table.php**
  - Made `tenant_id` nullable for central app support
  - Added `uploaded_by` foreign key

- **2025_10_22_123402_add_indexes_to_media_and_media_libraries_for_performance.php**
  - `media_model_collection_index` - Composite index for queries
  - `media_tenant_collection_index` - Tenant filtering optimization
  - `media_libraries_tenant_folder_index` - Folder filtering optimization

#### Schema Updates
```sql
-- Media Libraries Table
tenant_id (nullable) - Supports central + tenant contexts
folder_id (nullable) - Folder organization
uploaded_by - User tracking

-- Indexes for Performance
(model_type, model_id, collection_name)
(tenant_id, collection_name) on media table
(tenant_id, folder_id) on media_libraries table
```
