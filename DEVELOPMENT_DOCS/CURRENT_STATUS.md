## What's Complete ✅

**Backend:**
- Multi‑tenancy (Stancl), Passport OAuth2, Spatie permissions/activity/media
- PuckCompilerService with metadata injection (`gatherMetadata()`)
- NavigationObserver for automatic page recompilation
- HTTP caching (ETag, Cache-Control) on public page endpoints
- APIs: users, tenants, pages, navigation, media, settings, themes

**Frontend:**
- PageEditorPage with Puck visual editor (viewport switcher)
- PagesPage with full CRUD UI (create, read, update, delete with data table and forms)
- Navigation component with metadata support (instant rendering)
- Mobile navigation styles: none, hamburger-dropdown, off-canvas, full-width
- Public renderer for Puck pages with active theme
- Theme context + resolve() for tokens
- ColorPickerControlColorful with react-colorful (RGBA, theme swatches, semantic colors)
- CSS builder with theme token resolution for dynamic styles
- Media library with folders
- Dashboard pages: Themes, Users, Tenants, Settings, Activity, Roles/Permissions

**Performance:**
- Metadata injection eliminates 3+ API calls
- Server-side caching (1hr TTL) for metadata
- HTTP caching reduces bandwidth
- Navigation auto-recompiles on changes
